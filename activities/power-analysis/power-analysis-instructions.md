# In progress - Power analysis activity in G*Power

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals for today  

- Review the definition of power (in null hypothesis significance testing)  
- Review the purpose of power analysis  
- Review the pieces of information that are necessary to conduct a power analysis  
- Review different approaches to determine a target effect size   
- Learn how to conduct a power analysis for common experimental designs:
  - 1 group, 1 variable (t-test of mean)  
  - 

Power Analysis and Protocol Preparation
-	Power analysis (G*Power) based on expected/meaningful effect size
o	1 group, 1 variable (t-test)—d
o	1 group, 2 variable (correlation)—r
o	2 groups, 1 variable (independent samples t-test)—d (pooled SD)
o	>2 groups, 1 variable (ANOVA)—eta2 or Cohen f
o	1 group, 2 within × 2 within (repeated measures ANOVA)
o	2 group, 2 between × 2 within (mixed ANOVA)
-	Example of correcting for multiple tests—Bonferroni correction for post-hoc pairwise comparisons in 2 × 2 ANOVA
