# In progress - Power analysis activity in G*Power

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals for today  

- Review the definition of power (in null hypothesis significance testing)  
- Review the purpose of power analysis  
- Review the pieces of information that are necessary to conduct a power analysis  
- Review different approaches to determine a target effect size   
- Learn how to conduct a power analysis for common experimental designs:
  - 1 group, 1 variable (t-test of mean, effect size d)  
  - 1 group, 2 variable (correlation, effect size r)
  - 2 groups, 1 variable (independent samples t-test, effect size d with pooled SD)
  - more than 2 groups, 1 variable (ANOVA, effect size eta^2 or Cohen f)
  - 1 group, 2 within × 2 within (repeated measures ANOVA)
2 group, 2 between × 2 within (mixed ANOVA)
- Understand the effect of multiple comparisons on Type 1 error
  - Simple example of correcting for multiple comparisons - Bonferroni correction pairwise comparisons in 2 × 2 design
