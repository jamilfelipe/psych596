-   Examine variables and characterize their distributions using simple visuals (***jbnote - maybe add a normality test here too***)  


### Step 1 - L
-   Set up a typical project work flow consisting of a project folder containing:

    -   \*.Rproj file

    -   "r_docs" folder containing a \*.Rmd doc (R markdown doc)
