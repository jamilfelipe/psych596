Lecture List 2022-Fall

1. Syllabus and Policies (9/8/2022) - JB  
    - lab: installing software, workflow  
    - changes made:  
        1. minor addition to Collaborative Dataset  
        2. links to "cheat sheets"  
    - changes to consider:  
        1. workflow demonstration in front of class  
2. Choosing a statistical test (9/15/2022) - VL  
    - lab: importing & wrangling data  
    - changes made:  
        1. lab - wide-long pivot example in R activity (e.g. working with qualtrics output)  
3. Hypothesis testing (do's and don'ts) (9/22) - VL  
    - lab: power analysis  
    - changes made:  
        1. lab - simulation app for interaction tests  
        2. Lakens reading on approaches to sample size justification  
    - changes to consider:  
    - less time on lab activity, more time discussing articles, scenarios, and how to report sample size justification  
    - include examples of sample size statements (in 2022 these were in the Chi-square lecture)
    
4. Data visualization (9/29) -   JB
    - lab: data viz  
    - changes made: none  
    - changes to consider:
        1. more on between vs within error bars  
        2. examples of effective visualizations for different designs  
5. Associations between groups (10/6) - JB  
    - lab: correlations  
    - changes needed:  
        1. lab - "how to report" section  
6. Regression/making predictions (10/13) - JB  
    - lab: regression  
    - changes needed:  
        1. lab - "how to report" section  
7. Mediation and moderation (10/20) - VL  
    - lab: moderation/mediation  
    - changes needed:  
        1. lab - use longitudinal design example  
        2. lab - "how to report" section  
8. Comparing two groups (10/27) - VL 
    - lab: comparing two groups
    - changes made:  
        1. lab - "how to report" section  
9. Data Day (11/3) - no lecture - JB lead lab  
    - changes needed:  
        1. do the complete analysis ahead of time - there were a couple hiccups when trying to do it live.  
10. Comparing three or more groups (11/10) - JB (VL traveling)  
    - lab: anova  
    - changes made:  
        1. lab - "how to report" section  
11. Repeated measures/longitudinal design (11/17) - VL 
    - lab: rep measures anova  
    - changes made:  
        1. lab - add "how to report" section  
    - changes needed:
        1. would the sampling bias discussion work better in the next class where we use the collab dataset?  
12. Chi-square  & log linear analysis (11/21 - Tues) - VL 
    - lab: chi-square/loglin  
    - changes:  
        1. lab - add "how to report" section
